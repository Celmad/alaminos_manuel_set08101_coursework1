            <p class="paragraph">A Classical Cipher is an old form of cipher, a form of encrypted message with the whole purpose of sending secret messages to somebody else, and only a few people knew how to decode them. Some use examples were in war times, with the famous "ATTACKATDAWN" and similars. As shown, classical ciphers were letters(A-Z) based messages.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There are two main types of classical ciphers: Substitution cipher and Transposition ciphers. The first one is all about changing individual letters following some kind of rule. The later is encrypted by swapping letter positions.</p>
